# Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL

## Background Project 
In today's highly competitive business landscape, analyzing the performance of an eCommerce business is critical to success and sustainable growth. This project will explore the importance of leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language) as a powerful tool for gaining actionable insights into eCommerce performance.

on this occasion, I will analyze the business performance of an eCommerce company, taking into account several business metrics, by reviewing customer growth, product quality, and type of payment. 

## Data Preparation 
Before starting data processing, the first step that must be done is to prepare the raw data into structured and ready-to-process data. The following eCommerce dataset consists of 8 datasets that will interact with each other. So the steps taken are as follows:

- Create a new database and its tables for the data that has been prepared by paying attention to the data type of each column.
- Importing csv data into the database by paying attention to the dataset storage path.
- Create entity relationships between tables, based on the schema in Figure 1. Data Relationship. 
- Then export the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in the form of an image by setting the data type and naming the columns between interconnected tables.

After making adjustments to the Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK), the following ERD results are generated as shown in figure 2.
