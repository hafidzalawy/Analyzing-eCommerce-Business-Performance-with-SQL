# Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL

## Background Project 
In today's highly competitive business landscape, analyzing the performance of an eCommerce business is critical to success and sustainable growth. This project will explore the importance of leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language) as a powerful tool for gaining actionable insights into eCommerce performance.

on this occasion, I will analyze the business performance of an eCommerce company, taking into account several business metrics, by reviewing customer growth, product quality, and type of payment. 

## Data Preparation 
Before processing the data, the first step that needs to be done is to prepare the raw data so that it becomes structured data and is ready for processing. The datasets used in this project are 8 datasets which have a relationship with one another. Below are the steps for data preparation:

- Create a new database and its tables for the data that has been prepared by paying attention to the data type of each column.
- Importing csv data into the database by paying attention to the dataset storage path.
- Create entity relationships between tables, based on the schema in Figure 1. Data Relationship. 
- Then export the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in the form of an image by setting the data type and naming the columns between interconnected tables.

After making adjustments to the Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK), the following ERD results are generated as shown in figure 2.
