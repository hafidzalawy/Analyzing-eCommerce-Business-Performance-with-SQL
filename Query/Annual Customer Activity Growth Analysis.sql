--Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis

--1 Shows the average monthly active user (MAU) per year

SELECT year, FLOOR(AVG(customer_total)) AS avg_mau
FROM (
	SELECT 
		date_part('year', od.order_purchase_timestamp) AS year,
		date_part('month', od.order_purchase_timestamp) AS month,
		COUNT(DISTINCT cd.customer_unique_id) AS customer_total
	FROM orders_dataset AS od
	JOIN customers_dataset AS cd
		ON cd.customer_id = od.customer_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2
	) AS sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;

--2 Shows total new customers per year

SELECT year, COUNT(customer_unique_id) AS total_new_customer
FROM (
	SELECT
		Min(date_part('year', od.order_purchase_timestamp)) AS year,
		cd.customer_unique_id
	FROM orders_dataset AS od
	JOIN customers_dataset AS cd
		ON cd.customer_id = od.customer_id
	GROUP BY 2
	) AS sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;

--3 Displays the number of repeat customer orders per year

SELECT year, count(customer_unique_id) AS customer_repeat_order

		ON cd.customer_id = od.customer_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2
	HAVING count(2) > 1
	) AS sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;

--4 Displays the average frequency of orders for each year

SELECT year, ROUND(AVG(freq), 3) AS avg_frequency_order
FROM (
	SELECT
		date_part('year', od.order_purchase_timestamp) AS year,
		cd.customer_unique_id,
